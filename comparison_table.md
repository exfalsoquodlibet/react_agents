|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach to Reasoning**    | Explicitly incorporates a reasoning step, where the model generates thoughts or rationales about the problem and potential actions. | The reasoning process is often implicit, with the model directly deciding which tool or function to call based on the task. |
| **Structure**                | Follows a more structured thought-action-observation cycle, where each step is clearly delineated. | May have a less rigid structure, focusing primarily on selecting and using the appropriate tools. |
| **Transparency**             | Tends to be more transparent, as the reasoning process is explicitly stated and can be examined. | The decision-making process may be less visible, focusing more on the outcomes of tool usage. |
| **Flexibility**              | Can potentially handle a wider range of tasks, even those not explicitly defined by available tools. | Generally limited to tasks that can be accomplished with the predefined set of tools or functions. |
| **External Knowledge Integration** | Often designed to incorporate external knowledge more fluidly, as part of its reasoning process. | Typically relies more heavily on the specific capabilities of the provided tools. |
| **Prompting Approach**       | Often uses more elaborate prompts that guide the model through the reasoning and acting steps. | May use simpler prompts focused on task description and available tools. |
| **Iteration**                | Emphasises an iterative process where each cycle informs the next.            | May be more straightforward, with less emphasis on building upon previous steps. |
